# Fun-with-images
A page that displays random gifs for certain search terms to demonstrate my knowledge of APIs.

Press on a button at the top to see gifs related to that topic. 

Type a new topic into the input box and press enter (or the button) to add a new topic button.

Click the heart under a gif (or double click on a gif) to add it to your "Favorites" which can be accessed with the "Favorites" button. This should persist even when refreshing the page.
    You can also choose whether the favorites display most recent first, or oldest first, by clicking the arrow button under the "add topic" button

Press the "Load More" button at the bottom of the page to load ten more gifs related to the topic selected.
